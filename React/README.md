### Create React App

## Components:

### Functional Components
Functional components are some of the more common components that will come across while working in React. These are simply JavaScript functions. We can create a functional component to React by writing a JavaScript function. These functions may or may not receive data as parameters. In the functional Components, the return value is the JSX code to render to the DOM tree. Functional components can also have state which is managed using React hooks.

### JSX
JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows writing HTML in JavaScript and converts the HTML tags into React elements.

### Props vs State
Props (short for “properties”) and state are both plain JavaScript objects. While both hold information that influences the output of component render, they are different in one important way: props get passed to the component (similar to function parameters) whereas state is managed within the component (similar to variables declared within a function).
